<p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Chris Goosen and welcome to my blog!</p>
<p>I work as a Technology Consultant based in <del>Sydney, Australia </del> <del>Dallas, Texas</del> Sydney, Australia. I am a highly skilled IT professional with a passion for technology and more than two decadesâ€™ experience designing, implementing and migrating Microsoft infrastructure. I have become known for my deep technical knowledge and earned a reputation for my attention to detail, communication and interpersonal skills. In 2011, I became the second person in Australia to earn the Microsoft Certified Master (MCM) certification for Exchange 2010. I have represented Microsoft as a V-TSP for Online Services (Office 365) and have been a speaker at global industry conferences like Microsoft TechEd and Ignite. In 2014, I was awarded the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) Award for Office 365 and have received this award every year since. This award is given to exceptional technical community leaders who actively share their high quality, real world expertise with others.</p>
