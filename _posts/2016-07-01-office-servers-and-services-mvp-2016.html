<p>I've been traveling this week and spent a couple of days in Washington D.C were I presented two sessions at a small technology conference for overseas schools (K-12). I had a great time presenting and interacting with attendees from all over the world - my Microsoft focussed sessions definitely stood out at a conference heavily dominated by Google.</p>
<p>The highlight of my week was the email I received this morning from the Microsoft MVP program presenting me with a 2016 MVP award. This is my third MVP award and as always I'm honored to part of the MVP community.&nbsp;I'm very fortunate to have the opportunity to interact with so many folks who I admire and respect as often as I do.</p>
