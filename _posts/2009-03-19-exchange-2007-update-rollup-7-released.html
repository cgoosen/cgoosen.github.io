<p>A mere 5 weeks after Update Rollup 6, Microsoft have released Update Rollup 7 for Exchange 2007 Sp1. The update fixes around 50 issues.</p>
<p>For more info on the update and to download it, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953469">KB953469</a>&#160;</p>
<p>I would like to highlight the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Note Certain Exchange Server 2007 managed code services may not start after you install this update rollup. This is true if the services cannot access the following Microsoft Web site:   <br /><a href="http://crl.microsoft.com/pki/crl/products/CodeSigPCA.crl">http://crl.microsoft.com/pki/crl/products/CodeSigPCA.crl</a> </p>
<p>For more information about how to resolve or to work around this issue, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:    <br /><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/944752">944752</a> Exchange 2007 managed code services do not start after you install an update rollup for Exchange 2007&rdquo;</p>
<p>I also strongly recommend reading the &ldquo;Known Issues&rdquo; section before applying this update.</p>
