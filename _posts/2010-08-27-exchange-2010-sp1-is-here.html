<p>In <a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/2010/04/first-look-at-exchange-2010-sp1/" target="_blank">April I posted</a> about some of the new features that will be available in Exchange 2010 SP1. The most notable of these is the ability to provision a user&rsquo;s personal archive to a different mailbox database from their primary mailbox. </p>
<p>Many people have been eagerly awaiting the release of SP1, the good news is that it is now available for download. For more information, see this <a href="http://msexchangeteam.com/archive/2010/08/25/455861.aspx" target="_blank">Exchange Team Blog entry</a>. </p>
