<p>After an interesting and somewhat different keynote, Tech-Ed 2011 has officially kicked off. While everyone is enjoying a few cold ones, I thought I would take the time to tell you about some of the sessions I am excited about attending this year.</p>
<p>There are many great speakers at Tech-Ed this year, these are just some of the sessions I plan to attend.</p>
<ul>
