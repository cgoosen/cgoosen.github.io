<p>There have been reports of an issue impacting some customers which have RIM BlackBerry devices connecting to Exchange 2010 SP1 with RU3. The product team are working with RIM to identify the exact scenarios, narrow down the root cause of the problem and identify a suitable resolution for it. During this time the download page for Update Rollup 3 has been disabled.</p>
<p>If you are seeing duplicate messages being delivered when an email is sent from a BlackBerry device and you have RU3 installed within your Exchange 2010 environment, contact <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/2010/ff396001.aspx">Microsoft Support</a> for assistance in troubleshooting the issue you&rsquo;re experiencing.</p>
<p>It is recommended at this time that everyone hold off deploying RU3 until they have identified and resolved the issues. If you have already deployed RU3 and you are not seeing any issues within your environment, leave RU3 in place at this time.</p>
