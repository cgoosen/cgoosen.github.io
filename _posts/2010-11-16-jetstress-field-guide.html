<p>I&rsquo;m often asked by my customers and colleagues about Jetstress. While I always recommend that Jetstress be used to validate their storage design during an Exchange implementation, I&rsquo;ve never really seen any good documentation to refer them to. Until now that is! </p>
<p>Neil Johnson from MCS has recently published a great whitepaper that explains the process and requirements for validating an Exchange storage solution prior to releasing an Exchange deployment into production. His whitepaper explains how Jetstress works, how to plan for and perform a test, and how to automate the process. His whitepaper, &ldquo;Jetstress Field Guide&rdquo;, can be used with any version of Exchange.</p>
