<p>In order to assist customers in designing their storage layout for Exchange 2007, Microsoft put together a calculator that focuses on driving the storage requirements (I/O performance and capacity) and what the optimal LUN layout should be based on a set of input factors. </p>
<p>The Mailbox Server Role Storage Requirements Calculator has recently been updated to version 16.3.</p>
