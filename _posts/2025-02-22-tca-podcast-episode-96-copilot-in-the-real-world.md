In this episode we sit down with our old friend Antonio Maio. We recorded this episode at Microsoft Ignite 2024 in Chicago, and as always it was an enjoyable conversation with actionable insights. Antonio shares some tips from this Ignite talk to help you:
- Assess your environment at scale
- Protect your information
- Educate your users

Antonio gives us some great information about preparing for Copilot, why it helps to encourage everyone to build their own relationship with Copilot and how to find the balance between data protection and productivity.
