<p>This post is slightly off-topic compared to my regular posts, but its something I&rsquo;ve been thinking about for some time now and has been one of those things sitting on my to do list that always gets trumped by something more important. </p>
<p>While my blog has never been inaccessible from mobile devices, I have never really put much thought or effort into improving the experience for mobile users. I was recently reading some interesting statistics on the explosive growth of mobile internet usage and that prompted me to do something about it. These statistics are probably best summarised by this:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/image.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/image_thumb.png" width="471" height="408" /></a></p>
<p>You will now be able to access all the same content from your mobile device in a much more mobile friendly manner. And just because I am a geek I&rsquo;ve even added a .mobil domain name so you&rsquo;ll also be able to access it at <a href="http://cgoosen.mobi">http://cgoosen.mobi</a></p>
<p>I also wanted to share this great video that goes into some smartphone mobile marketing statistics. Don&rsquo;t worry.. I don&rsquo;t ever intend on introducing ads or marketing of any kind here, I just think the stats are interesting.</p>
