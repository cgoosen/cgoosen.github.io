<p>Yesterday I attended the IBM Lotusphere Comes to You event here in Sydney. I was excited to see what the IBM Unified Communications strategy would be and ended getting a lot more than I had bargained for.</p>
<p>The event covered a large part of their portfolio from Messaging and Collaboration, UC and Web Portals to Cloud Computing. As a consultant, I have always taken an interest in what &ldquo;the other guys&rdquo; are doing, but, being honest, the last time I saw Domino was back in version 6. </p>
<p>I was most impressed with how slick the Notes 8.5 client looks and the fact that they have integrated everything into a single client whether it be IM, voice &amp; video, document libraries, opening and editing MS Office docs with Symphony, even SAP integration, it can all be done via the Notes 8.5 client.</p>
<p>One of the themes that became immediately obvious was value.. ROI is important, especially in today&rsquo;s economic climate and IBM seem to be on top of that, a great example is <a href="http://symphony.lotus.com/software/lotus/symphony/home.nsf/home">Lotus Symphony</a> which is a free, MS Office compatible suite that includes a word processor, spreadsheet editor and presentation editor. I was also impressed by the fact that IBM have realised that (as predicted by Gartner) Apple&rsquo;s market share in the desktop space is growing and that Windows may not always be the desktop OS of choice, and I think they have catered for this really well by making their software platform independent so it will run on Windows, OSX, and Linux.</p>
<p>In the Cloud Computing space, <a href="https://www.lotuslive.com/">LotusLive</a> is their solution to online collaboration and it is available now, offering online meetings, hosted email and more.</p>
<p>So, what about UC and more specifically, voice stuff? does &ldquo;the pbx killer&rdquo; a.k.a OCS R2 have some competition? IBM are calling it UC&sup2; and, well.. I liked what I saw, they certainly have some innovative little features, very easy to use and will certainly make collaboration &ldquo;child&rsquo;s play&rdquo;. They are certainly working with an impressive list of business partners as well. I would say though, that with the maturity of OCS R2 and the fact that it is available now I think IBM may just have missed the boat a little. UC&sup2; will be available &ldquo;later this year&rdquo; and given the momentum OCS already has, it&rsquo;s going to be interesting..</p>
