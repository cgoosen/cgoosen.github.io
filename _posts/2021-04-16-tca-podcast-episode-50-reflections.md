Episode 50! In this episode we reflect on our journey to 50 episodes - thinking about the fun we've had, everything we've learned and the guests we've had the privilege to speak to along the way. This is definitely a more personal episode, but don't worry - we also discuss the much talked about Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities and the recent Azure AD outage.
