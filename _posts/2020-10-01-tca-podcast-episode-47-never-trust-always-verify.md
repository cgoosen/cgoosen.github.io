Zero Trust is a term that is thrown around a lot these days and seems to mean many different things to different folks. At its core, Zero Trust is a philosophy or security concept whereby no one is trusted by default on the network, and verification is always required from everyone attempting to access any resources. In this episode we sit down with Ashwin Pal to better understand Zero Trust, why it can be complex to adopt and how to get started on your journey.
