<p style="clear: both">I am a little surprised that there has not been more noise made about this.. thought I would do my bit as I am a totally against internet censorship..</p>
<p style="clear: both">The Australian Federal Government is pushing forward with a plan to force ISPs to censor the Internet for all Australians. I can think of several, non-technical reasons why this is a really bad idea.. for all the info, including a call to action, check out the NO CLEAN FEED website <a href="http://www.nocleanfeed.com/" target="_blank">here</a><u><br /></u></p>
