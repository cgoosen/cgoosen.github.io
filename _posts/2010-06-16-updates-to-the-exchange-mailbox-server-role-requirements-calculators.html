<p>The Exchange 2007 and Exchange 2010 Mailbox Server Role Requirements Calculators have recently been updated. If you use either of these tools often, you&rsquo;ll no doubt appreciate how much effort must to into keeping them updated. </p>
<p>Apart from some bug fixes, there have been a few enhancements too, for the Exchange 2010 calculator, these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added two new columns to the primary datacenter &ldquo;Active Database Configuration / DAG&rdquo; table.&#160; These columns now expose the total number of databases activated in each site after server failure events.&#160; This change was added to expose cross-site database failover events.</li>
<li>The calculator now includes an option to activation block secondary datacenter mailbox servers that host HA database copies.&#160; This allows you to design a solution where you can activate the secondary datacenter in the event of a primary datacenter failure mode, or choose to activate a copy in the secondary datacenter manually, but prohibits Active Manager from automatically activating a copy in the secondary datacenter.&#160; </li>
<li>Added support for 32-cores.</li>
</ul>
<p>For detailed information on these and other enhancements, see the following links:</p>
