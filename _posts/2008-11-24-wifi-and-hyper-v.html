<p>Anyone who has played around with server 2008 and hyper-v would have noticed that you are not able to bind a virtual network to a wireless network adapter and more than likely (although i have not personally tested it) a 3g or other mobile broadband card. I guess the reason for this is that most people would probably not need to do this, BUT, I did.. after asking google, I found 3 ways around this, my preferred method is the last one.</p>
<p>Methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using ICS - <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2008/01/09/using-hyper-v-with-a-wireless-network-adapter.aspx" target="_blank">see Ben Armstrong's blog</a></li>
<li>Using RRAS - <a href="http://www.adopenstatic.com/cs/blogs/ken/archive/2008/01/17/15530.aspx" target="_blank">see Ken Schaefer's blog</a></li>
<li>Using Bridging - <a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/john_paul_cook/archive/2008/03/23/using-wireless-with-hyper-v.aspx" target="_blank">see John Paul Cook's blog</a></li>
</ul>
