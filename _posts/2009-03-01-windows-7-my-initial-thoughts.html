<p>While some of my &ldquo;bleeding edge&rdquo;&rdquo; colleagues have been running and blogging about Windows 7 for a while now, its taken me a little longer to get my hands dirty. I decided to rebuild my Lenovo T61 yesterday and see what all the fuss was about.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image-thumb.png" width="400" height="237" /></a>The installation was seamless and quick, as you would expect. It found drivers for all my devices. I did have some trouble getting my Novatel Wireless 3G HSDPA card to work, the installation would not run at all, not even using Windows Vista compatibility mode. I downloaded the drivers off the Novatel website and managed to get the card installed that way. Works perfectly after I created a new connection through &ldquo;Network and Sharing Center&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the moment, I am very much of the opinion that it is Windows Vista with some cosmetic changes, but that&rsquo;s probably unfair of me to say since I have only been using it for a few hours. I&rsquo;ll be sure to report any cool new features.</p>
<p>Now I have to make it productive so I can get some work done when I get into the office tomorrow!</p>
