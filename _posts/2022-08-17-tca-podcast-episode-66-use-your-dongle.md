In this episode we chat to James "UCMadScientist" Arber. Some of you may know him as the guy who [ran Doom on a Sonus/Ribbon SBC 1000](https://www.ucmadscientist.com/running-doom-on-a-teams-isdn-gateway/) or [set fire to a Polycom CX series phone](https://www.ucmadscientist.com/teams-3pip-phones-getting-the-wrong-dial-plan/), but James is also extremely knowledgable when it comes to all things Microsoft Teams. We had a lot of fun talking about the current state of Teams, room systems, devices, and the importance of using your dongle.
