<p>I can&rsquo;t believe how quickly this year has gone, it is almost time for me to start packing my bags for another trip..&nbsp; I'll be attending the Microsoft Exchange Conference 2012 (MEC) in Orlando, September 24th-26th. I am really looking forward to this great opportunity to learn about the product from the engineers who built it. There will be more than 100 sessions, some of the topics that will be covered in breakout sessions, keynotes and hands-on labs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exchange Server 2013 Architecture</li>
<li>Security and Protection in the new Exchange</li>
<li>Configuring built-in Anti-Malware/Anti-Spam protection</li>
<li>Setting up Data Loss Prevention policies</li>
<li>Compliance, eDiscovery and Archiving in the new Exchange</li>
<li>Exchange Server 2013 Manage Availability and Monitoring</li>
<li>Unified Messaging in Exchange Server 2013</li>
<li>Exchange Server 2013 Deployment and Exchange Server 2010 Coexistence</li>
<li>Moving to the cloud with Exchange Online and Office365</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know if you are also planning to attend, it would be great to catch up!</p>
