<p>Microsoft <a href="http://community.office365.com/enus/office365/b/microsoft_office_365_blog/archive/2011/03/16/office-365-and-blackberry.aspx" target="_blank">recently announced</a> that they are in the process of updating pricing for the Hosted BlackBerry Service for Exchange Online to make it available free of charge. From the 16th of March 2011, BlackBerry mobile e-mail for new Exchange Online customers is now free through the Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS).&#160; For existing customers, a further announcement is expected later this month on how to take advantage of this change.</p>
<p>In addition, Hosted BlackBerry service will be available for free with Office 365 after it launches later this year.</p>
