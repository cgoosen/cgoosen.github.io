<p>I am delighted to announce that after a very long month of waiting for the results of the final &ldquo;qual lab&rdquo;, I passed and have earned the Microsoft Certified Master | Exchange Server 2010 certification.</p>
<p>The MCM program differentiates itself through expert-led training. The curriculum is    <br />developed in conjunction with Microsoft product engineering teams and delivered by industry-renowned instructors and practiced experts within their fields of discipline. Instructors use their numerous years of experience to ensure that students receive authoritative information on the successes and challenges of applying course concepts to real-world customer situations. I knew it would be challenging, but when day 1 ended up being 17 hours long we all knew we would be in for more than we could have ever imagined.</p>
<p>In order to successfully pass and be able to call yourself an MCM you need to get through 3 very difficult theory exams and then face the beast, otherwise known as the &ldquo;qual lab&rdquo;. Without going into it in too much detail, it is a very intense 3 weeks. How intense? read <a href="http://borntolearn.mslearn.net/careerfactor/b/bojan/archive/2011/01/17/mastering-the-aspirations.aspx" target="_blank">Bojan Nenadic&rsquo;s Blog</a></p>
<p>I have to say thanks to all my rock star instructors and classmates.. I am humbled and truly grateful to have shared this experience with you all.</p>
