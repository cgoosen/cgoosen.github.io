<p>Microsoft recently released&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2506146" target="_blank">KB2506146</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2506143" target="_blank">KB2506143</a>&nbsp;as optional updates depending on your which server version you are running (2008 SP2 or 2008 R2 SP1)</p>
<p>The update includes&nbsp;Windows Management Framework 3.0 and more specifically PowerShell 3.0 which is not supported on either Exchange 2007 or Exchange 2010. There have <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2012/12/14/windows-management-framework-3-0-on-exchange-2007-and-exchange-2010.aspx" target="_blank">been reports</a> of it causing issues with the installation of rollups&nbsp;resulting in an error code of &ldquo;1603&rdquo; appearing in the event log.</p>
<p>It is recommended that&nbsp;Windows Management Framework 3.0 should not be installed on servers running either Exchange 2007 or Exchange 2010. Uninstalling&nbsp;Windows Management Framework 3.0 reportedly fixes the issues.</p>
