<p>Have you ever had to figure out what version of Exchange a build number is referring to or vice versa? There is a <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh135098.aspx" target="_blank">very handy TechNet article</a> that lists every build number and release date since Exchange 4.0.837 (Exchange Server 4.0 Standard Edition, June 11 1996)</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/bshukla" target="_blank">Bhargav Shukla</a> also has <a href="http://cid-14adc5cf1e0cbccf.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/Blog-Bhargavs/Exchange/Get-ExchangeUpdateRollups.ps1" target="_blank">a great script</a> that can be used to find Exchange 2007 and Exchange 2010 build numbers in your environment.</p>
