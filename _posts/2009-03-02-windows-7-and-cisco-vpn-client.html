<p>So, managed to get everything installed and working great yesterday, really fought with the Cisco VPN client, but I eventually managed to get it working (or so I thought!) installed all windows updates before shutting down last night .. arrived at the office a little earlier this morning, turn my laptop on, BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH!, happened a few times yesterday while I was fiddling with the Cisco VPN client so I figured I&rsquo;d just repair it and try again, only, this time I was not so lucky..</p>
<p>To cut a long and frustrating story short: Windows 7 rebuilt and looking good again..</p>
<p>For the Cisco VPN client, I tried many things, this is how I managed to get it to work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Citrix <a href="ftp://files.citrix.com/dneupdate.msi">DNEupdate</a></li>
<li>Reboot</li>
<li>Take ownership and delete ndis.sys (in c:\windows\system32\drivers).</li>
<li>Take ownership and delete ndis.sys.mui (in c:\windows\system32\drivers\en-us).</li>
<li>Install Cisco VPN Client 5.0.04.0300.</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
<li>Windows 7 will repair itself (should take a few seconds) and automatically reboot.</li>
<li>Cisco VPN Client should work without any other tweaks.</li>
</ul>
