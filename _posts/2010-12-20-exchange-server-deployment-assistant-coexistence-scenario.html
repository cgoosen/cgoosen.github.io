<p>I <a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/2009/11/exchange-server-2010-deployment-assistant/" target="_blank">previously posted</a> about the Exchange Server Deployment Assistant. The Deployment Assistant asks you some questions about your particular Exchange environment and, based on your answers, it provides a checklist with instructions that are designed to help you deploy Exchange 2010 quickly and easily. Each step has a huge amount of valuable information to guide you through your deployment.</p>
<p>This great tool has recently been enhanced to include rich coexistence information for those interested in maintaining some users on-premises and some users hosted by Microsoft Office 365 for enterprises in the cloud. As of now, the available scenario is targeted solely at those organizations with a current Exchange 2003 on-premises implementation, but additional scenarios for supporting Exchange 2007 and Exchange 2010 will be coming soon.</p>
