<p>I&rsquo;ve been dying to take the new Outlook for Mac (for Office 365 subscribers) for a test drive ever since <a href="http://blogs.office.com/2014/10/31/new-outlook-mac-available-office-365-customers/" target="_blank">I saw the announcement late last year</a>. Having used both Entourage and Outlook for Mac 2011 in the past, I was excited to see what improvements the new version would bring. Let&rsquo;s be honest, as good as they were, both the previous iterations were miles behind the Windows version of Outlook (which I live in daily). </p>

<p align="left">While I haven&rsquo;t spent an extended period of time using the new Outlook for Mac, I have to say I actually love it so far and I think it is safe to say that Outlook for Mac is no longer the poor cousin. I am really looking forward to the release of the next Office for Mac!</p>
<p>The new Outlook for Mac is currently only available to Office 365 commercial customers, Office 365 Home, Office 365 Personal and Office 365 University subscribers while the release of the next version of Office for Mac is currently planned for the second half of 2015.</p>
