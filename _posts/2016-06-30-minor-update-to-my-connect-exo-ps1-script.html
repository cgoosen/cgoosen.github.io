<p>I've just published an updated version of my Connect-EXO.ps1 script. This version, (version 3.2) includes a very minor fix for those using German language keyboards. This update is the result of testing and feedback from the TechNet community and I wanted to thank all those involved.</p>
<p>I have been planning some big updates to this script and work on version 4.0 will begin soon - watch this space!</p>
<p>The update has been published to the TechNet Gallery,&nbsp;<a href="http://cgoo.se/1srvTiS" target="_blank">it can be downloaded by clicking here&hellip;</a></p>
