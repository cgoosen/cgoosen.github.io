<p>The Exchange Team <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2013/05/06/ask-the-perf-guy-sizing-exchange-2013-deployments.aspx" target="_blank">recently released</a> some great guidance on how to size Exchange 2013 deployments. I think this is a really comprehensive post and as expected, the guidance is in favour of multi-role deployments. There is no &ldquo;calculator&rdquo; spread sheet out yet, however we should see one released soon. Read the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2013/05/06/ask-the-perf-guy-sizing-exchange-2013-deployments.aspx" target="_blank">full post here</a></p>
