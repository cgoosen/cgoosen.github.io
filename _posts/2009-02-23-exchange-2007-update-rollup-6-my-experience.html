<p>On 12 Feb <a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/2009/02/exchange-2007-update-rollup-6/" target="_blank">I blogged about Exchange 2007 Update Rollup 6</a> having been released and that it also includes a fix for the critical security issue that was published under <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-003.mspx?pubDate=2009-02-10" target="_blank">Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-003</a>. </p>
<p>I have seen a lot of posts on the internet about problems experienced after applying this update, so I recently decided to apply the update to a non-production environment. Here are my experiences.</p>
<p>About the environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 x CAS servers in a NLB</li>
<li>2 x Hub transport servers</li>
<li>1 x CCR Mailbox cluster</li>
<li>All servers run Server 2008 with SP1</li>
<li>All servers are physical machines</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The only "strange" thing I experienced was that the installer sits on "Creating native images for .NET assemblies..." for more than an hour.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image2.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="332" alt="image" src="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/image-thumb2.png" width="555" border="0" /></a>&#160;</p>
<p>After it does complete, and the servers are rebooted, everything seems to work perfectly.I had no problems with services not starting or OWA not working after applying this update.</p>
