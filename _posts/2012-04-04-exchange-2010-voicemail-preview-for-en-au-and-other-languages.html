<p>One of the downsides of using Exchange 2010 voicemail is that if you live in an English speaking country other than the United States (en-US) you have to set your Exchange language pack to en-US if you would like to make use of the Exchange voice mail preview feature. This has been a source of constant debate around our office as we have quite a multinational team. There are a few of us who don&rsquo;t actually mind the American sounding prompts/greetings/etc.. but then there are those who do. In a attempt to keep everyone happy my friend and colleague Greig Sheridan decided to investigate and found quite a neat workaround.</p>
<p>Basically, what he has done is set the Default language of the Dial Plan to en-US, and then changed EVERY other reference to the language back to en-AU. The end result is that the only time you hear a greeting in the American accent is when you dial the Subscriber Access number, before you&rsquo;ve logged-in.
