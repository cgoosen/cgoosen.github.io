<p>That&rsquo;s right.. as we already know, when Exchange 2007 was released, a 32-bit version (which was unsupported in production environments) was made available for use in lab environments, for demos etc.</p>
<p>This will not be the case with Exchange 2010 as Microsoft will not be shipping a 32-bit version at all. What now? well.. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll all agree that this a probably a good thing in the long run, forcing organisations to start seriously considering the deployment of 64-bit servers for things other than Exchange, like, for example DC&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It certainly is the start of a interesting journey, hopefully other software vendors will be prompted to start making more of an effort to make their applications 64-bit compliant too, it is, in my opinion, long overdue!</p>
