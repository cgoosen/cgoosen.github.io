  content: Cool stuff. Have you thought about running it through PSSharper (part of
    ISEsteroids) in ISE? It's making a few suggestions.

  content: "Hello, I read your roadmap about install auto install prerequisites, maybe
    you can use the work of https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/O365InstallsConnectionsps1-e4821bf1\r\n(careful,
    the download links is outdated and Azure AD in version 1).\r\n\r\nIn addition,
    you could add to parameters:\r\n-install : to install as a module (like the script
    above)\r\n-commandline : to launch the script in command line (in fact, it is
    more flexible when we want to use your script in another big script)\r\n\r\nPost
    your script on github could be interesting for collaboration on it :)"

  content: "Hi Chris, Great stuff thanks. When trying to run it from powershell core
    6 it complies about \r\n[System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName('presentationframework')
    being a problematic way \r\nAvoid Binding on Partial Assembly Names from best
    practice document and apparently 'presentationframework' is an obsoleted dll in
    framework 4.5 and newer.\r\n\"This method has been deprecated. Please use Assembly.Load()
    instead.\" \r\nCan you rework this and use the more modern approach so it has
    a chance of eventually working across win/mac/linux on powershell core"

<p>I'm excited to announce the release of Connect-365! Back 2012, I put together a basic script with a GUI to simplify connecting to Exchange Online via remote PowerShell. I had never intended to make the script publicly available and it was just something I used myself. After a couple years I realized that it had been shared with so many colleagues and clients that I decided to clean it up and publish it on the TechNet gallery. Connect-EXO was born! Here's a screenshot of the original first version:</p>
<p><a href="/assets/img/2017/03/Capture1.png"><img src="/assets/img/2017/03/Capture1.png" style="width:300px;height:281px;" /></a></p>
<p>Over time the script matured <a href="/2014/10/script-connect-exo-ps1-connect-to-exchange-online-using-remote-powershell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">into what Connect-EXO is today</a>. One of the challenges in the early version was that I used WPF for the GUI, this was problematic for older versions of PowerShell so I made the decision to port it to Windows Forms for backward compatibility. Forms is old and added a lot of bloat and since&nbsp;backwards compatibility is no longer a concern, I decided to move back to WPF. Connect-365 is essentially the next version of Connect-EXO, I renamed it so more accurately reflect it's purpose and this will allow me to continue to maintain Connect-EXO.</p>
<p >Connect-365 features a GUI that will prompt for your tenant credentials and then connect to various Office 365 services using remote PowerShell. The built-in prerequisite checker will check to ensure that the correct modules are installed and provide a download link for those that are not.</p>
<p>The current version of the script allows connectivity to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exchange Online</li>
<li>Azure Active Directory (using v2 module)</li>
<li>Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center</li>
<li>Skype for Business Online</li>
<li>SharePoint Online</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong><br />
This script will work natively in PowerShell 4.0+</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong><br />
There are no parameters or switches, simply execute the script: <em>.\Connect-365.ps1</em></p>
<p><strong>Execution Policy:</strong><br />
This script has been digitally signed and will run just fine under a "RemoteSigned" execution policy</p>

<p><strong>Roadmap:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><del>Support Azure AD v1 and v2</del> - Removed as v1 is depreciated</li>
<li><del>Support for Exchange Online MFA (via module)</del> - Done!</li>
<li>Derive SPO Admin URL</li>
<li>Auto-install prerequisites</li>
<li>Much more..</li>
</ul>
