It's almost time for Microsoft Ignite 2020, but this year things are going to be a little different. In this special episode, Anna Chu (a.k.a The Community Khaleesi) gives us some inside info about what to expect this year and how you can get involved! If you're interested in being part of Ignite this year, the [Microsoft Ignite Call for Moderators](https://t.co/AQQQuTAOKl) is now open and closes on August, 24.
