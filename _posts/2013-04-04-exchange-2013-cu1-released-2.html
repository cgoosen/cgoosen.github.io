<p>Following the <a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/2013/02/exchange-2010-sp3-released/" target="_blank">release of Exchange 2010 SP3</a> in February, the Exchange Team have <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2013/04/02/released-exchange-server-2013-rtm-cumulative-update-1.aspx" target="_blank">announced the release of Exchange Server 2013 Cumulative Update 1 (CU1)</a>. CU1 does include some new features, including *some* access Public Folder content through Outlook Web App but I think it is fair to say that legacy coexistence is the reason everyone has been waiting for CU1. CU1 is the minimum version of Exchange 2013 required for on-premises coexistence with supported legacy Exchange Server versions, but, before you steam ahead and install it I think it is important to understand all the caveats of coexistence so be sure to <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa998636(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank">check out the Planning and Deployment documentation</a>. Scott Schnoll put together a great <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/scottschnoll/archive/2013/04/02/high-availability-changes-in-exchange-server-2013-cumulative-update-1.aspx" target="_blank">post about the high availability changes in Exchange 2013 CU1</a> which is also worth reading.</p>
<p>The Exchange 2013 CU1 release notes are <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj150489(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank">available here</a> and you can <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38176" target="_blank">download it here</a></p>
