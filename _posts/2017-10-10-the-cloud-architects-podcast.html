<p>Better late than never.. I'm delighted to annouce that I'll be joining <a href="http://thearchitects.cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cloud Architects Podcast</a> as a co-host. Started by fellow MVPs <a href="https://twitter.com/nicolasblank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicolas Blank</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/warrendt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warren du Toit</a>, the Cloud Architects podcast is about best practice, guidance, news and cutting edge Microsoft cloud technologies - I'm really excited to be involved.</p>
<p>Microsoft&nbsp;Ignite gave us a great opportunity to connect with and talk to some really interesting people - those episodes will be published soon, but in the meantime, we recently recorded in introductory episode where we talk about some of the complexities of adopting cloud technologies at scale:</p>
