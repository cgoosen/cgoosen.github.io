No language encryption here... In this episode we have the honor of sitting down for a late-night discussion with our Dutch friends Koos, Jeroen and Maarten. We really enjoyed their interesting and unique perspective on the global threat landscape and how the ransomware-as-a-service economy continues to grow. We also talk about cyber warfare, the challenge of attack attribution and share some practical guidance on how keep your organization secure.
