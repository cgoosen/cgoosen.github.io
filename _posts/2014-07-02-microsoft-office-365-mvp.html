  content: "Chris,\r\nWe are deploying 365 more and more these days but with each
    deployment we run into hurdles.  This one has me baffled.  Client had 3 other
    domains where email currently lives.  New domain created for 365.  We can IMAP
    the other accounts and alias any additional address. The client wants to be able
    to send From: any of the now 4 domain addresses which is possible with the IMAP.
    \ What happen when the 3 domains go away?  Now there isn't and IMAP account but
    the client still wants to send as if it were still there."

  content: other accounts will be imported into O365 and will be added to the users
    as aliases when the other IMAP servers go away.

  content: found my own answer.  Distro Grps, Grp Delegation, Send As.  You have to
    create Distro grps for each alias and add the primary address to each group but
    it works.

<p>Today was a good day! It stared out in Music City &ndash; Nashville, Tennessee, I went for an early morning run and was getting ready to kick-off my first project since relocating to the U.S a few weeks ago when, just after 8am I received an email informing me that I had been presented with a 2014 Microsoft MVP Award for my contribution to Office 365 technical communities during the past year.</p>
<p>I am extremely honoured to receive this award and join the MVP community, a community which I have long respected and admired.</p>
