<p>Documentation is something we all rely on, especially in today&rsquo;s rapidly changing cloud world where the only constant seems to be change. Perhaps I&rsquo;m a little obsessive, but I constantly use Microsoft&rsquo;s documentation to confirm things, even when I already know the answer. Like many people though, I never really considered what goes into making sure I have something to refer to and keeping it up to date with all the change going on. Nicolas and I had the pleasure of sitting down with Brenda Carter and Joe Davies from the Microsoft Documentation Team at Ignite recently to talk about how they do what they do, how you can help and what it takes to be a technical writer.</p>
