<p>In case you missed my session at TechEd Australia last week the session recording and slide deck is available on <a href="http://cgoo.se/18TNT8Y" target="_blank">Channel 9</a> or by clicking here: <a title="http://cgoo.se/18TNT8Y" href="http://cgoo.se/18TNT8Y">http://cgoo.se/18TNT8Y</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently working a series of posts about Public Folder migration to Exchange Online. I touched on it during the session, but will be publishing more details in the series so look out for it soon.</p>
