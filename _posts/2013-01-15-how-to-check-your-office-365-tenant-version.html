<p>Ever wondered what version of Exchange your tenant is provisioned on? <a href="http://michaelvh.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Michael Van Horenbeeck</a> has written quick post on how to determine this. I think this will be really handy in the near future so I wanted to share it. </p>
<p>You can check the version by issuing the following cmd via powershell:</p>
<blockquote><p>Get-OrganizationConfig | ft AdminDisplayVersion,IsUpgradingOrganization</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Michael has some great information in his post that <a href="http://michaelvh.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/how-to-check-what-the-version-of-your-tenant-is-in-the-cloud-office-365/" target="_blank">can be found here</a> so be sure to check it out.</p>
