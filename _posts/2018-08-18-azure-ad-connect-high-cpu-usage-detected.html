<p>I recently started receiving a lot of emails from Azure AD Connect Health in one of my lab environments indicating that my AAD Connect server was experiencing high CPU usage:</p>
<p><a href="/assets/img/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-18-at-1.34.18-PM.png"><img src="/assets/img/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-18-at-1.34.18-PM.png" style="width:818px;height:569px;" /></a></p>
<p>I remembered seeing a tweet from fellow MVP<a href="https://twitter.com/expta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;Jeff Guillet</a> about this - He's been tracking this for a while and as it turns out the issue is caused by a buggy Windows update for .NET framework. You can read all about it in the following posts on his&nbsp;<a href="http://www3.expta.com/blog.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The EXPTA {blog}</a>:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.expta.com/2018/07/azure-ad-connect-version-118800.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure AD Connect version 1.1.880.0 includes many updates</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Upgrading to AAD Connect&nbsp;1.1.880.0 fixed the issue for me.</p>
