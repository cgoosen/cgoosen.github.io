<p>Just in case you missed it, Exchange 2010 SP2 was released earlier this month. The following features and functionality has changed since Service Pack 1 for Exchange 2010:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hybrid Configuration Wizard </li>
<li>Address Book Policies </li>
<li>Cross-Site Silent Redirection for Outlook Web App </li>
<li>Mini Version of Outlook Web App </li>
<li>Mailbox Replication Service </li>
<li>Mailbox Auto-Mapping </li>
<li>Multi-Valued Custom Attributes </li>
<li>Litigation Hold</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to call out a couple of these that I have been eagerly awaiting:</p>
<p><strong>Hybrid Configuration Wizard     <br /></strong>Exchange 2010 SP2 introduces the Hybrid Configuration Wizard which provides you with a streamlined process to configure a hybrid deployment between on-premises and Office 365 Exchange organizations. Hybrid deployments provide the seamless look and feel of a single Exchange organization and offer administrators the ability to extend the feature-rich experience and administrative control of an on-premises organization to the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-Site Silent Redirection for Outlook Web App</strong>    <br />In Exchange 2010 SP1, there was three types of redirection for OWA in Exchange 2010 on-premises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manual Redirection </li>
<li>Temporary Manual Redirection </li>
<li>Legacy Silent Redirection (for Exchange 2003/2007)</li>
</ul>
<p>With Exchange 2010 SP2, you can enable a silent redirection when a Client Access server receives a client request that is better serviced by a Client Access server located in another Active Directory site. This silent redirection can also provide a single sign-on experience when forms-based authentication is enabled on each Client Access server.</p>
