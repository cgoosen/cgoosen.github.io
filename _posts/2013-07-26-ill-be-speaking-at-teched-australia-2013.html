<p>Mario Tevanian (Microsoft) and I will be presenting a &ldquo;Exchange 2013 Hybrid Deployments&rdquo; session at TechEd Australia 2013 (3-6 September, Gold Coast) The session will provide an overview of the complete range of migration options that are available when migrating to Exchange Online and discuss the new Exchange 2013 hybrid configuration wizard. Did you know that public folders are now supported in Exchange Online? Come and learn more about modern public folders and how to migrate them. In this session we also share some notes from the field and highlight the recommended approach and best practices you should consider as you plan to migrate your existing Exchange environment to Exchange Online. </p>
<p>Room and time slot details are not available yet, but I&rsquo;ll share them as soon as I know what they are. The session code is: EXL314. See you there! </p>
