<p>It&rsquo;s here! <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/ad/archive/2015/06/24/azure-ad-connect-amp-connect-health-is-now-ga.aspx" target="_blank">Yesterday, Microsoft announced</a> the general availability of Azure AD Connect (AAD Connect). Over the years the humble DirSync tool has evolved and AAD Connect is the simplest way yet to integrate on-premises AD identities with Azure Active Directory. There has been a lot of confusion out there about which tool to use for directory synchronization but Microsoft has been hard at work on one tool to rule them all and as noted on the Microsoft Azure site, this tool is AAD Connect:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Azure AD Connect incorporates the components and functionality previously released as Dirsync and AAD Sync. These tools are no longer being released individually, and all future improvements will be included in updates to Azure AD Connect, so that you always know where to get the most current functionality.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the great features of AAD Connect is that it will upgrade your existing deployment of DirSync or AAD Sync, it&rsquo;s a simple wizard and 5 clicks away!</p>
