<p>So you&rsquo;ve arrived in the Gold Coast, checked in, unpacked, visited the gym and checked out the pool (right?) now what? I was planning which sessions to attend over the next few days and thought it would be a good idea write a post about it.</p>
<p>Firstly, I would definitely recommend that you get to registration as soon as possible to avoid the rush! Registration will be open until 9pm tonight and then again from 7am tomorrow morning. Once registered you can also pick up your HP Mini Notebook (of course I am writing this post on it!), there is an &ldquo;unpacking area&rdquo; in the convention centre if you would like to dispose of the box and packaging.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img-0064.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="IMG_0064" border="0" alt="IMG_0064" src="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img-0064-thumb.jpg" width="262" height="253" /></a> </p>
