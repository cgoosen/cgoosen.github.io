<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been on everyone's mind recently. GDPR became enforceable on 25 May 2018 and is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all&nbsp;individuals within the European Union. It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU and aims primarily to give control to citizens and residents over their personal data and how that data is used. It seems a lot a organizations left their GDPR strategies to the very last minute - I received a lot of GDPR related email that week!&nbsp;What does it all mean and why should we care? We had the pleasure of talking to Tony Redmond about it recently.</p>
