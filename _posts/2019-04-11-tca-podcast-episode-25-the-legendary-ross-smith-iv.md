If you’ve ever used the Exchange Server Role Requirements Calculator or consulted The Exchange Preferred Architecture you’ll be very familiar with the work of our guest, Ross Smith IV. Nic and Warren caught up Ross to talk about his 19-year tenure at Microsoft and his new role in Intune Engineering, giving us a sneak peak into some of the innovation we can look forward to in Outlook for iOS and Android.
