  content: Great job Chris, This worked for me. In my case the account had actually
    been deleted and then re-created. This allowed that account back into Exchange
    2010!

<p>I was running through the Exchange 2010 installation process earlier today, during the installation process, everything went really smoothly and I only had &ldquo;green ticks&rdquo;!</p>
<p>Once done, I opened the Exchange Management Console and saw the following error:</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;The following error occurred when searching for On-Premises Exchange server:[myservername.local] Processing data from remote server failed with the following error message: The user "domain\username" isn't assigned to any management roles. For more.... It was running "Discover-ExchangeServer - USeWIA $true -SupressError $true&rsquo;</em></p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/error.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="error" border="0" alt="error" src="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/error_thumb.png" width="554" height="126" /></a> </p>
<p>It was rather confusing at first as I had completed the installation using an admin account that was a member of the Enterprise Admins group. Digging a little deeper, saw the following error in the event log:</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/error2.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="error2" border="0" alt="error2" src="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/error2_thumb.png" width="484" height="338" /></a> </p>
<p align="left">After some further digging, I realised what had happened. A colleague of mine did the AD schema preparation using his admin account a few days ago, during that part of the process, the account being used was automatically added to the &ldquo;Organization Management&rdquo; AD security group. When I then resumed the installation process with my account, I was not a member of this group. To rectify the problem, I had to manually add my account to the &ldquo;Organization Management&rdquo; AD security group.</p>
