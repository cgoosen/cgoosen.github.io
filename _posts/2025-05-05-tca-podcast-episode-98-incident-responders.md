In this episode we are joined by guests Ernie Anderson and Darrell Switzer from TBDCyber to discuss the critical topic of incident response (IR). Ernie and Darrell share their insights and experiences in IR. They highlight the importance of having a well-prepared incident response plan, how to effectively use EDR tools, and the value of proactive measures such as vulnerability testing and tabletop exercises. We also discuss the challenges of modern ransomware attacks, the role of cyber insurance, and the need for adaptive communication strategies during incidents. Both guests underscore the necessity of constant updating, testing, and training to ensure organizational resilience against cyber threats.
