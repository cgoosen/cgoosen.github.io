<p>Microsoft have announced official support for the Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2 member server role on a server that has a Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system installed. Now for the fine print.. the following scenarios are currently not supported on Windows Server 2008 R2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group Chat will not function in a Windows 2008 R2 forest or when Group Chat member servers are joined to a Windows 2008 R2 domain. Some issues with changes in Windows 2008 R2 require a Group Chat Client and Group Chat Admin Tools hotfix, scheduled for mid-April 2010.</li>
<li>Deploying Group Chat on Windows 2008 R2 is currently not supported. </li>
<li>Upgrading the operating system to Windows Server 2008 R2 for an existing installation of OCS 2007 R2 is not supported.</li>
<li>Installing 32-bit OCS 2007 R2 administration tools on 64-bit Windows 2008 R2 is not supported.Development with Speech Server 2007 Developer Edition and deployment of the Speech Server 2007 role are not supported on Windows Server 2008 R2.</li>
