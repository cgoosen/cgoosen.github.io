<p>The last few weeks have been incredibly busy.. I spent a week in Europe and presented a <a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/2017/06/dank-je-wel-haarlem/" target="_blank">couple of sessions at Office 365 Engage</a> in The Netherlands and after a quick laundry stop at home I headed off to Washington D.C were I presented two sessions at a small technology conference for overseas schools (K-12). That&rsquo;s two conferences and four sessions in two weeks &ndash; I was pretty exhausted at the end of it all but was super excited when I received an email from the Microsoft MVP program informing me that I had been awarded my fourth Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) Award. </p>
