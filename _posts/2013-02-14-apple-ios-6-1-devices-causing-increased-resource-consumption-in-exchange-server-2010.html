<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Update:</span> <a title="iOS 6.1.2 Software Update &ndash; Fixes Exchange calendar bug" href="http://www.cgoosen.com/2013/02/ios-6-1-2-software-update-fixes-exchange-calendar-bug/">iOS 6.1.2 resolves this problem</a></p>
<p>I have see a lot of reports lately about the Apple iOS 6.1 bug effecting organisations using Exchange 2010. The problem appears to occur when a user using a Apple device (iPad, iPhone, etc) with iOS 6.1 responds to or edits a single instance of a recurring calendar event, this causes excessive log growth and a significant increase in memory and CPU resource consumption in turn causing server performance to be affected. Both <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2814847" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> and <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4532" target="_blank">Apple</a> have released support articles for this bug, but at the time of writing it has not been fixed.</p>
<p>If you do currently have a large iOS device fleet, I would suggest advising your users against upgrading their devices until this is resolved. If you are already experiencing resource problems on your Exchange servers, I strongly suggest using either a custom throttling policy for iOS 6.1 users or blocking iOS 6.1 users completely. For more information on these workarounds, see the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2814847" target="_blank">following Microsoft support article.</a></p>
