Another in-person episode! We recorded this one at the MVP Summit in Redmond earlier this year and had a great time talking to Katie and Pablo about community as they introduced us to The Microsoft Security Customer Connection Program (CCP). Katie and Pablo help us understand the value the program provides to both Microsoft and its customers, how they gather feedback and what the requirements are to join the program.

Here are the links mentioned during the episode:
*   [Security Connection Program (CCP)](https://aka.ms/joinccp)
*   [Microsoft Security Community](https://aka.ms/securitycommunity)
