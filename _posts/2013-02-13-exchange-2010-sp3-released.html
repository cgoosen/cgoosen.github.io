<p>A few moments ago the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2013/02/12/released-exchange-server-2010-sp3.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Exchange Team</a> announced the availability of Exchange 2010 SP3. I can&rsquo;t remember any other service pack that has been as eagerly anticipated as this one, mostly because SP3 will allow coexistence with Exchange 2013 which was <a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/2012/10/exchange-2013-is-rtm/" target="_blank">released late last year</a>. Unfortunately, it appears that customers wanting to introduce Exchange Server 2013 into their existing Exchange 2010 environment will have to wait just a little longer for the release of Exchange 2013 CU1, or at least that is how I interpret the following release note on the Exchange Team Blog:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Exchange 2010 SP3 allows Exchange 2010 servers to coexist with Exchange 2013 CU1, which is also scheduled to be released in Q1 2013. Customers can test and validate this update in a representative lab environment prior to rolling out in their production environments as an important coexistence preparatory step before introducing Exchange Server 2013 CU1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This service pack also resolves numerous issues, a list of these <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2013/02/12/released-exchange-server-2010-sp3.aspx" target="_blank">can be found here</a>.</p>
