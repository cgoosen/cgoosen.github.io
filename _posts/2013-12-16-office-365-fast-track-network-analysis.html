  content: I know this is an old thread.  As of 2 weeks ago, it was still a current
    thread.  The Fasttrack testing pages have been removed and if anyone knows of
    a replacement, please share.

<p>Back in 2011 I posted about the <a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/2011/11/microsoft-online-services-internet-connection-performance-test/" target="_blank">Microsoft Online Services Internet Connection Performance Test</a> which was a tool that helped measure response times, bandwidth, and overall connection quality in preparation for consuming Microsoft Online services. The tool disappeared without warning after a while and was never replaced. A few months ago now it seems a new tool was made available, however I seem to have missed the announcement and only recently came across it. The Office 365 Fast Track Network Analysis tool is a similar web based tool that performs various connectivity tests and presents the results in a easy to read report. It looks very similar to the old speedtest.microsoftonline.com tool, but performs a few more tests:</p>
