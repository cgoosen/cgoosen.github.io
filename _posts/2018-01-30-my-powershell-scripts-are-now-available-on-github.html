<p>Ever since I first started sharing scripts on my blog, I've had a bunch of people reach out to me with stories of how they've used my code in their projects or offering to collaborate with me on future versions. My intention has always been to make my scripts easily downloadable and ready to run - one of the reasons why I sign the code with a code signing certificate, but I've come to realize that there is no reason why I couldn't do both.</p>
<p>Over time my own development and version&nbsp;control methodologies have matured and I've been very successfully using git to manage my own projects. After a recent conversation with fellow <a href="https://eightwone.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MVP Michel de Rooij</a>&nbsp;about his use of GitHub as a repository for his scripts, I decided to follow suit and have&nbsp;created a public GitHub repositories for each of my scripts. You <a href="https://github.com/cgoosen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can find these here.</a></p>
<p>I will continue to make code signed versions of my scripts available in the TechNet gallery for those who prefer to just download and use them. Links to those are below:</p>
