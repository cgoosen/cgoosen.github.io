We love Exchange Server! No, really - I've personally been working with Exchange Server in some form or fashion since Exchange Server 5.5 in the late '90s and in some circles that makes me a late bloomer. It is difficult to ignore what seems like an endless list of day-zero vulnerabilities that have plagued our old friend over the last 12 - 18 months. These vulnerabilities have seen security researchers pointing the finger and the tech press calling Exchange Server a security liability. It's 2022, should you really still be hosting your own email? In this episode, Nic and I discuss the relevance of Exchange Server and attempt to answer this question.

During this episode we refer to a couple of recent articles, here are the links:
*   [Your Microsoft Exchange Server Is a Security Liability](https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-exchange-server-vulnerabilities/)
*   [It Really is Time to Say Goodbye to On-Premises Exchange](https://practical365.com/time-to-dump-exchange-server/)
