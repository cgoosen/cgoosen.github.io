<p>I was looking around the attachments section of the MS Exchange Team blog earlier trying to find an older version of the Exchange 2010 Mailbox Server Role Requirements Calculator when I came across &ldquo;E2010+MBX+Role+Calc+Spoof.xlsx&rdquo; I was curious to see what it was so I downloaded it.. lets just say it was not the version I was looking for, but it made me laugh..</p>
