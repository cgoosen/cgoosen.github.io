<p>There has been a serious lack of original content on my blog this month, with the financial year coming to an end here in Australia, I&rsquo;ve been flat out</p>
<p>Never fear though, Scott Schnoll over at <a href="http://msexchangeteam.com" target="_blank">The Microsoft Exchange Team Blog</a> has put together a great 4 part video series on high availability in Exchange Server 2010:</p>
<p>In <a href="http://msexchangeteam.com/archive/2009/05/18/451353.aspx" target="_blank">Part 1</a> he introduces the concept of database mobility, and the features known as database availability groups (DAGs) and mailbox database copies.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://msexchangeteam.com/archive/2009/05/21/451400.aspx" target="_blank">Part 2</a> he demonstrates how to create a DAG and how to add mailbox servers to a DAG</p>
<p>In <a href="http://msexchangeteam.com/archive/2009/06/03/451542.aspx" target="_blank">Part 3</a> he shows how to add a mailbox database copy</p>
<p>and, in <a href="http://msexchangeteam.com/archive/2009/06/14/451609.aspx" target="_blank">Part 4</a> he performs a database switchover using the Exchange Management Console (EMC)</p>
