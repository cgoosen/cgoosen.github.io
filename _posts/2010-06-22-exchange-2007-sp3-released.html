<p>In November last year <a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/2009/11/exchange-2007-on-windows-2008-r2/" target="_blank">I mentioned</a> that Windows 2008 R2 support for Exchange 2007 was been announced. The Exchange product team <a href="http://msexchangeteam.com/archive/2010/06/21/455145.aspx" target="_blank">yesterday announced</a> the release of Exchange 2007 Service Pack 3 (SP3). </p>
<p>SP3 for Exchange 2007 enables Exchange 2007 to be installed on the Windows Server 2008 R2 version of the operating system as well as Windows 7 support for the Exchange management tools. Other enhancements include advanced protection options against e-mail security threats, such as spam and viruses and tools which help manage internal compliance and high availability.</p>
