  content: What are the odds? My name is Chris, I've got a T61 that I just upgraded
    to Win7, and I was looking for some information to hookup my fingerprint scanner.
    Thanks!

  content: "I installed the latest version from Lenovo but it gives me error \r\n\r\nFingerprint
    Software 5.9.2 for Windows 7 (32-bit) \r\nVersion 5.9.2.5859\r\nRelease Date:

    when I enter the password to enroll, it gives me error \"The dependency service

    solution found with the message or errors as Windows 7 error messages will be
    updated in a while, I suppose.\r\n\r\nSo now I am downloading\r\n\r\nUPEK biometric

    the software is 37.72 MB compared to Lenovo's 15 MB\r\nb) The version Lenovo published
    and release date is the latest than the OEM.\r\n\r\nI hope I fix this. But no
    idea which service it wants to start, guess it is vtapi. But the file assosciated,
    may be I will have to check on a working XP and then manually create the service
    for W7.\r\nBut let me try install the UPEK package first."

    laptop with the RTM release of Windows 7 and the UPEK drivers worked perfectly.
    Good luck!

<p>After rebuilding my trusty T61 with Windows 7 about a week ago, the only device that was not functioning correctly was the &ldquo;biometric coprocessor&rdquo;. I tried installing the software using ThinkVantage Productivity Center, but this did not work. After asking google, I found that the device was manufactured by UPEK and that they have released a Windows 7 driver on their site. <a href="http://www.upek.com/support/downloads/windows7/w7x86.asp">Download it here.</a></p>
<p>The process of enrolling a fingerprint is fairly simple in Windows 7. Open Control Panel, select &ldquo;Biometric Devices&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image2.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image-thumb2.png" width="244" height="53" /></a> </p>
<p>Select &ldquo;Use your fingerprint to log on to Windows&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image3.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image-thumb3.png" width="585" height="147" /></a> </p>
<p>When prompted, enter your password</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image4.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image-thumb4.png" width="379" height="210" /></a> </p>
<p>Select the appropriate finger (its probably a good idea to select more than one!)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image5.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image-thumb5.png" width="498" height="374" /></a> </p>
<p>Follow the instructions:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image6.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.cgoosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image-thumb6.png" width="420" height="283" /></a> </p>
<p>All done!, next time you log on, just use your finger!</p>
