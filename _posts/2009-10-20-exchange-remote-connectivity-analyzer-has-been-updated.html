<p>The Exchange Team have released an updated version of the <a href="https://www.testexchangeconnectivity.com/" target="_blank">Exchange Remote Connectivity Analyzer</a></p>
<p>The tool simulates several client logon and mail flow scenarios. When a test fails, many of the errors have troubleshooting tips to assist you in correcting the problem. You may recall <a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/2008/12/microsoft-exchange-server-remote-connectivity-analyzer/" target="_blank">reading about it before..</a></p>
<p>Some new features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated user interface </li>
<li>New CAPTCHA implementation</li>
<li>Updated the Outlook Anywhere test logic to work with Exchange 2010</li>
<li>Added a password confirmation text box to ensure the proper password was entered before running a test. This will reduce the number of tests that fail simply due to a typo in the password.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Additional tests include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exchange Web Services - This allows you to perform connectivity testing for Exchange Web Services client such as Entourage. Developers can also use the Service Account Verification test to ensure things are configured and working properly for access with an alternate account or Exchange Impersonation. </li>
<li>Outbound SMTP - Performs Reverse DNS testing, DNS RBL Checks, and SenderID validation against a provided "outbound" IP address</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
