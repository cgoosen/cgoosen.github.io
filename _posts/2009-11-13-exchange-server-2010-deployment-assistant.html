<p>Now that Exchange 2010 has been officially launched and made available, I&rsquo;m sure many organisations are already thinking about or planning their deployment. I my opinion, this will be especially true for those who still have Exchange 2003 deployed.</p>
<p>Microsoft have once again stepped up and just when you thought they&rsquo;ve outdone themselves, they announce the release of the Exchange Server 2010 Deployment Assistant. This awesome tool is a result of feedback from the early adopters of Exchange 2010 and of course Microsoft wanting to help streamline the experience of deploying Exchange 2010.</p>

<p>The current version offers the Upgrade from Exchange 2003 scenario.Once the deployment scenario is selected, you are taken through a series of questions and then presented with a list of steps to complete. Each step has a huge amount of valuable information to guide you through your deployment.</p>

<p>Additional scenarios will be available in early 2010, these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade from Exchange 2007</li>
<li>Upgrade from Exchange 2003/2007</li>
<li>New installation of Exchange 2010</li>
</ul>
