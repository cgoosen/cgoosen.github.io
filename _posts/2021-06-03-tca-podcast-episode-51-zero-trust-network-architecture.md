After our recent 'reflections' episode, we felt it would be a great idea to catch up with our long-time sponsor KEMP to talk about how the load balancing world has changed in recent years. As we find ourselves moving away from the traditional fixed perimeter and rethinking 'castle and moat' principles an inevitable question arises, where does the humble load balancer fit into today's Zero Trust world?

In this episode, Nic and Warren connect with KEMP's Jason Dover to talk about their recent Flowmon aquisition and discuss the concept of Zero Trust Network Architecture (ZTNA). Jason shares some great tip for organizations who are looking to embark on their journey to Zero Trust and as always, Warren also talks about Kubernetes.
