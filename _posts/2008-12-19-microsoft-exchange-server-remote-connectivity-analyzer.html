<p>I first heard about this tool at Tech-Ed back in October. The Exchange Server Remote Connectivity Analyzer (ExRCA) tool is a neat online tool which allows Exchange Administrators to test and validate various aspects of their Exchange , including for example, Exchange 2003 RCP over HTTP. </p>
<p>The tool currently provides the following tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync Test</li>
<li>Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync AutoDiscover Test</li>
<li>Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 AutoDiscover Connectivity Test</li>
<li>Microsoft Office Outlook 2003 RPC/HTTP Connectivity Test</li>
<li>Inbound SMTP Email Test</li>
</ul>
<p>ExRCA can found at <a title="https://www.testexchangeconnectivity.com/" href="https://www.testexchangeconnectivity.com/">https://www.testexchangeconnectivity.com/</a></p>
