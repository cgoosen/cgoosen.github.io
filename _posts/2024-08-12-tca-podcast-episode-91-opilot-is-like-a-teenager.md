In this episode we welcome back a couple of our old friends Stephen Rose and Darrell Webster to talk about Copilot and AI - how useful or useless are these technologies and what does it take to get it to work as advertised. Our guest share some great insight on what is needed to make the most of AI and why so many organizations struggle soon after going all in. We each talk about our own favorite Copilot and how it has changed the way we work - and Warren has a conversation with ChatGPT about living on the moon.
