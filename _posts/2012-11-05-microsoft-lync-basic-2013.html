<h6><font size="3">Microsoft recently released Lync Basic 2013, a slimmer version of the Lync client that provides all the basic functionality available in the full version of Lync 2013. Some of the notable missing features in the basic client are advanced call features such as team ring, call forwarding, simultaneous ring, voice mail, call park, call delegation, response groups, and remote call control.</font></h6>
<p>As usual for all things Lync related, my friend Greig Sheridan has a <a href="https://greiginsydney.com/a-free-basic-client-for-lync-2013/" target="_blank">full write-up on his blog</a>.</p>
