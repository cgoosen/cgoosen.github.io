There is no denying that the rate of change in the Microsoft Cloud in astounding. Microsoft continues to innovate and improve very rapidly with new features often being deployed weekly. Security and Compliance is understandably a huge area of focus and it can be a challenge to stay up to date with all the continuous change - this challenge requires an innovative solution. We're excited to talk to our old friend and fellow MVP Michael Van Horenbeeck about his new book project 'Microsoft 365 Security for IT Pros' - a book all about Microsoft 365 Security with a monthly update cadence.
