<p>In case you missed it, the evolution of hardware has caused an architectural change in Exchange 2013.. gone are the 5 Exchange server roles that we have all come to know and love since Exchange 2007. In Exchange 2013 things are a lot more simple with only two server roles, namely, the Client Access server role and the Mailbox server role. Don&rsquo;t let the familiar names fool you though, there is nothing familiar about these roles. In Exchange Server 2013 there are two basic building blocks &ndash; the Client Access array and the Database Availability Group (DAG). Each provides a unit of high availability and fault tolerance that are decoupled from one another. Client Access servers make up the CAS array, while Mailbox servers comprise the DAG.</p>

<p>Ross Smith did a great job (obviously!) of introducing the new Exchange 2013 role architecture during the technical keynote at MEC 2012 last year.. if you have not already seen it, I highly <a href="http://www.iammec.com/video" target="_blank">recommend you watch it here</a>. He also recently publish the following post of the Exchange team <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2013/01/23/exchange-2013-server-role-architecture.aspx" target="_blank">blog that covers the same topic.</a></p>
