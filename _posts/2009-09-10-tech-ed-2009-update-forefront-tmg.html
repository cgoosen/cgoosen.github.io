    Hi Sam,
    Have a loot at Greg Taylor's whitepaper here: http://cgoo.se/pR40uP

    Jaap Wesselius also covers this in a video: http://cgoo.se/r15KvP

    Cheers,

<p>Today I attended the SEC208 session with Jamie Sharp which really provided a great overview of Microsoft Forefront Threat Management Gateway (TMG). If you use and like ISA server, you&rsquo;ll love TMG.</p>
<p>Some of the great new things we can look forward to are web filtering, URL filtering and it also has built in Exchange Edge Server functionality which means if you have an Exchange Edge Server role deployed and also use ISA server, you can now consolidate these into a single server. Another cool thing is, like Exchange Server 2010, TMG will only be available in 64bit.</p>
<p>TMG is currently available as beta3, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/DOWNLOADS/details.aspx?FamilyID=e05aecbc-d0eb-4e0f-a5db-8f236995bccd&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">click here to download it</a>. It is expected to be RTM towards the end of the year.</p>
