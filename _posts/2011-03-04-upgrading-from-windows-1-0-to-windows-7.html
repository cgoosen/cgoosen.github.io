<p>This one is slightly off topic, but I thought I would share it nonetheless. I recently came <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2011/03/02/someone-is-a-glutton-for-punishment.aspx" target="_blank">across a post</a> about someone who upgraded through every version of Windows from 1.0 to 7.</p>
<p>What is truly impressive about this is that there is some 20 years of application compatibility to be witnessed. Here is the very impressive video:</p>
<div style="padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; width: 575px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:0b1aa149-08c9-493d-b24f-8e1f9ea3a3fb" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent">
<div><object width="575" height="480"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vPnehDhGa14&amp;hl=en"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/vPnehDhGa14&amp;hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="575" height="480"></embed></object></div>
</div>
<p>The first thing I noticed when I watched this was that the author never installed Windows ME. I have since found his &ldquo;FAQ&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>1) Why Didn't you Install ME?     <br />Since Windows ME cannot be upgraded to 2000, I chose to install 2000 straight from 98 as it was chronologically the next release. I might do an "alternate history" version to see what going from 98 to ME to XP looks like.      <br />2) Did Doom 2 and Monkey Island work in Windows 7?      <br />Yes. Sorry I didn't point that out explicitly in the video.      <br />3) Can you do the same thing with Mac OS?      <br />I don't know enough about Mac OS to be able to say, and I would not be the best person to do that experiment as I have never been a Mac user.      <br />4) Where are you from?      <br />Scotland.</p>
