  content: I have a 2010 Exchange test enviroment and have downloaded SP1 to install
    and test. All of the updates and hotfixes are installed but when I try to install
    SP1 on my Mailbox, Hub Transport server it comes up with a warning, a yellow exlamation
    mark, in the prerequisites telling me I need to install the Microsoft Office 2010
    filter Packs. I installed them when I first installed Exchange 2010, but just
    incase I reinstalled them then re-ran SP1 setup with the same results. Any idea
    whats going on?

    I would suggest you install the Microsoft Office 2010 filter Packs as well.\r\n\r\n*Edit*\r\nCheck
    that you have both Microsoft Office 2007 and 2010 filter Packs installed."

  content: "Hi Mike,\r\nI performed a clean install a few weeks ago. Exchange 2010
    RTM requires  the Office 2007 Filter Pack. If you have not installed SP1 yet,
    I would suggest first installing it, then installing the Office 2010 Filter Pack
    which is required by SP1"

    Hi,

      I have a issue when installed Exchange 2010 SP1 on my Win2008 R2 machine.

     After installed KB977020 it keeps on asking me to install the Same KB in the pre-requisite set up. Can any one help me do that? I am directly pushing the Ex2010-SP1 on R2 machine

<p>I <a href="http://www.cgoosen.com/2010/08/exchange-2010-sp1-is-here/" target="_blank">recently posted</a> about the availability of Exchange 2010 SP1 and thought I would provide some feedback about the installation process.</p>

<p align="left">Before installing SP1 for Exchange 2010, there <font size="2">are</font> several updates and hot fixes that need to be installed first. An important thing to note is that <em>all the Unified Messaging language packs other than US English (en-US) need to be uninstalled before upgrading the Unified Messaging server role.</em> I have split these up then up by server role:</p>
