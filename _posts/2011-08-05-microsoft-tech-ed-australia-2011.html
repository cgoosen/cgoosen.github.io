<p>It&rsquo;s almost time to head to the Gold Coast for Tech-Ed 2011. I will be tweeting and blogging from the conference as usual. I will also be speaking this year so if you are attending, be sure to come over and say hi. </p>
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Toby Knight and I will be presenting session EXL311 entitled &ldquo;Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Office 365: From Simple Migration to a Hybrid Environment&rdquo;. Whether you&rsquo;re looking to migrate all of your mailboxes to the cloud or planning to run a hybrid environment, this is the session for you. We will cover how and when to take advantage of the Simple Exchange Migration which supports migrating existing Exchange on-premise customers who want to move all of their mailboxes to the cloud with full data fidelity. You will also learn how rolling out an Exchange 2010 server in your current Exchange environment prepares you for seamless integration with Exchange Online. Whether you are piloting a few users or moving a large part of your workforce to the cloud, we give you the technical details on Exchange-to-cloud integration that you need to be successful.</p>
<p>The session is currently scheduled for Wed, 31 Aug at 5 PM. See you there!</p>
