<p>I've just published an updated version of my Connect-EXO.ps1 script. Version 3.1 includes the ability&nbsp;to connect to the&nbsp;Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center. Based on the options selected it will connect to either or all&nbsp;services with Exchange Online being the only one selected by default. Here is a screenshot of the new interface:</p>
