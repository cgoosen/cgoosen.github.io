<p>Every now and then I have a need to contact Office 365 support in order to help a customer resolve a particular issue. Logging a support request is easily done via the &ldquo;Support&rdquo; menu in the Office 365 admin portal, however it usually takes me a while to find a a contact telephone number for Office 365 support. The support engineers always have phone numbers listed in their email signatures, however these are rarely local numbers.</p>
<p>Earlier today, I was once again in a position where I needed to call Office 365 support and since I had to call from my mobile phone, an international number just wasn&rsquo;t going to work. I finally found this link buried in some support documentation and thought I would post it here in order to help someone else out and spare myself the effort next time I need it.</p>
