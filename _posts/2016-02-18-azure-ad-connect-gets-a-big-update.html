<p>In case you missed it, the latest version of Azure AD Connect (version 1.1.105.0) was <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-aadconnect-version-history/" target="_blank">recently made available for download.</a> One of the big changes and great new additions in this version is the new built-in scheduler which was separate to the sync engine in previous releases and would run as a scheduled task in Windows task scheduler:</p>

<p>Another big change is the fact that the default synchronization frequency has been updated and is now 30 minutes which is a big change from the previous default of 3 hours. In addition, this value can now be configured which is something that was not supported previously &ndash; I know this change is going to be very well received by many organizations. The scheduler can be viewed and configured using the</p>
<p>{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  Get-ADSyncScheduler
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  Set-ADSyncScheduler
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>cmdlets. You can also manually start a synchronization cycle with the</p>
<p>{% highlight ruby linenos %}
  Start-ADSyncSyncCycle
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>cmdlet</p>
<p><a href="/assets/img/2016/02/Capture3.png"><img src="/assets/img/2016/02/Capture3.png" style="width:669px;height:223px;" /></a></p>
<p>As before, the upgrade process from previous versions is very simple &ndash; The wizard will detect the previous installation and ask to if you would like to upgrade:</p>
<p><a href="/assets/img/2016/02/Capture2.png"><img src="/assets/img/2016/02/Capture2.png" style="width:622px;height:438px;" /></a></p>
<p>You will notice after the upgrade that the old Azure AD Sync Scheduler task no longer exists in Windows task scheduler</p>
<p><a href="/assets/img/2016/02/after.png"><img src="/assets/img/2016/02/after.png" style="width:741px;height:105px;" /></a></p>
<p>Other new features in this release are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic upgrade feature for Express settings customers.</li>
<li>Support for the global admin using MFA and PIM in the installation wizard.</li>
<li>Support changing the user's sign-in method after initial install.</li>
<li>Allows Domain and OU filtering in the installation wizard.</li>
</ul>
