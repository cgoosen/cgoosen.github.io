<p align="left">Those of you who frequent my blog (or follow me on twitter) will know that I am strongly to any form of internet censorship. Here in Australia the government is currently trailing new ISP level filtering which threatens to reduce our internet to a state comparable to China, <a href="http://www.nocleanfeed.com/" target="_blank">read more here</a></p>
<p align="left">In New Zealand, they have recently pass some crazy copyright law that calls for internet disconnection based on accusations of copyright infringement without a trial and without any evidence held up to court scrutiny. This is due to come into effect on February 28th unless immediate action is taken by the National Party.</p>
<p align="left">Join thousands of New Zealanders (hey, I am not even kiwi!) already against this law by blacking out your Facebook photo, your websites, your Myspace pages, your Twitter account, in protest against this unjust new law that may come into effect on February 28.</p>
<p align="left">I have "blacked out" my blog and twitter avatar to show my support!</p>
